	Chef has started working at the candy store. The store has 100 chocolates in total. Chef’s daily goal is to sell X chocolates. For each chocolate sold, he will get 1 rupee. However, if the Chef exceeds his daily goal, he gets 2 rupees per chocolate for each extra chocolate. If the Chef sells Y chocolates in a day, find the total amount he made.

Program

#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int total_choco=100,x,y,a,b;

    printf("1 rupees for his normal goal:%d",a);
    printf("\nwhen exceed his goal:");
